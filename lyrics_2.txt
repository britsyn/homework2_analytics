Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb
In bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man who won't let himself be

Down in a hole
Feelin' so small
Down in a hole
Losin' my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the Sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole
Feelin' so small
Down in a hole
Losin' my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied

Bury me softly in this womb (oh, I wanna be inside of you)
I give this part of me for you (oh, I wanna be inside of you)
Sand rains down and here I sit (oh, I wanna be inside of you)
Holding rare flowers in a tomb
In bloom (oh, I want to be inside)

Down in a hole
Feelin' so small
Down in a hole
Losin' my soul

Down in a hole
Feelin' so small
Down in a hole
Outta control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
